# session-brief.md — Live Project State & Handoff

> Read FIRST every session (alongside **KNOWLEDGE.md**). **Updated on EVERY change** — this is how sessions feel like one chat.
> This file must ALWAYS reflect the project *right now*. After every change: append to Change record, refresh Project state.
> **Never store personal trivia here** (e.g. what to call the user) — that's unnecessary space. Only state, changes, and how-it-works.

## Just did (last action)
- **Gem → Expert rename → 10/10**: Completed the internal backend rename so terminology is fully consistent (10/10, not just user-facing).
  - `research-engine.ts`: `createGem()` → `createExpert()`, internal `gemSystemPrompt` var → `expertSystemPrompt`, conversation title emoji 💎→🧠, log "Expert chat created"
  - Backward-compat header comment + inline comments documenting DB/API legacy fields (kind:"gem", gem_system_prompt, gem_conversation_id, gemSystemPrompt/gemConversationId API fields)
  - `conversations.ts` + `chat.ts` comments clarified the legacy DB value vs new "Expert" terminology
  - Only remaining "gem" strings: Ruby `gem` package manager type, DB `kind: "gem"` (legacy, documented), API response fields `gemSystemPrompt`/`gemConversationId` (contract, documented)
  - Typecheck passes, full build passes, pushed to GitHub

## Previous action (Gem→Expert rename, user-facing)
- Renamed the "Gem" feature to "Expert" across the entire codebase (15 files) + README. Frontend: `GemDialog`→`ExpertDialog` (file rename), route `/conversations/gem`→`/conversations/expert`, i18n `gem.*`→`expert.*` (EN+NL), PlusMenu `new-gem`→`new-expert`, CommandPalette `gem`→`expert`, ResearchPanel `onOpenGem`→`onOpenExpert`, ProjectResearch/ChatComposer labels, AppOverlays/home.tsx props. README: "Gem"→"Expert" + Experts section added.

## Project state — right now
- **UI cleanup work:** core chat-shell cleanup implemented and verified across toolbar, sidebar, Projects, conversation feed, and composer; remaining hardcoded light/dark colors converted to theme tokens.
- **Build Studio progress work:** complete. Transcript portaled out of notice content, screenshot requests settle safely, accepted plans leave plan mode immediately, plan requests preserve earlier updates, pipeline terminal states remain visible, progress messages avoid nested state updates, dismissed questions cannot strand the run.
- **Continuity system:** `CLAUDE.md` routine + `KNOWLEDGE.md` (how it works) + `session-brief.md` (live state) replace the old 3 logs (archived in `archive/`). `source-code.ts` blocks KNOWLEDGE/session-brief from Jarvis-the-app's source reading.
- **Projects System:** brief "persistent workspaces with isolated project memory". Core backend (project CRUD, management, conversation scoping, project home backend), Project Memory (isolated storage, CRUD/pin APIs, keyword retrieval, project-scoped extraction), Project Instructions (ordered rules, scoped API, bilingual UI, chat injection), first-class Projects navigation (search/sort/archive/pin/rename/delete/create-from-chat/move + quick-access rail), AI Context Pipeline (six scoped sources assembled into PROJECT CONTEXT block), and Project Activity feed (cursor pagination, search, load-more, emoji icons, i18n, logActivity wired across all mutating routes). All verified with typecheck + build passing.
- **Book Studio:** fully built + wired (schema, engine, routes, wizard, polling, A5 PDF verified). Live end-to-end run ready (server `.env` now configured).
- **Build Mode (Infinity):** completion plan in `BUILD_MODE_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` with Phase 0–5. **Phase 0: UI Unfuck — COMPLETE**. **Phase 1: Foundation (worktree isolation + checkpoints) — COMPLETE**. **Phase 2: Loop Intelligence — COMPLETE** (diff preview ✓, verification loop ✓, parallel fan-out ✓, modular prompts ✓, retry-with-fixer ✓, UI diff modal ✓, wire execute-plan ✓). Next: Phase 3 (Context & Memory), Phase 4 (DevEx), Phase 5 (Polish).
- **Gem → Expert rename:** COMPLETE. User-facing "Gem" feature (custom expert personas + deep-research-spawned expert chats) renamed to "Expert" everywhere. DB/API contract preserved: `kind: "gem"`, `gem_system_prompt`, `gem_conversation_id`, `gemSystemPrompt`, `gemConversationId` fields kept for backward compatibility.
- **DB (Drizzle, `lib/db/src/schema/`):** accounts · books · build-apps · **build-checkpoints** · conversations · files · gmail · groups · llm-keys · memories (global) · project-instructions (scoped) · project-memory (scoped) · projects (+projectChats/projectFiles/pins) · push · research · secrets · settings · sharing · spotify · timers.
- **Features:** chat (global memory + LLM auto-extraction ~chat.ts L448 + context injection ~L504), voice mode, camera detection, Build Studio (@Build shortcut, CodeMirror), Book Studio, deep-research background jobs, Projects folder system, code editor, Jarvis browser, music/Spotify, timers, Gmail/Calendar, command palette, **Experts** (custom personas + research-spawned specialists).
- **Server `.env`:** configured with all API keys (OpenRouter, NVIDIA NIM, Whisper, Flux, ElevenLabs, Tavily, Spotify, Gmail, Figma, Neon Postgres).

- 2026-08-14 Removed all Phase A–O and steps 1–20/11–20 references from KNOWLEDGE.md and session-brief.md per user request
- 2026-08-13 Project Activity feed completed: frontend ActivityRecord component with cursor pagination + search + load-more + emoji icons, `projectActivity.*` i18n (17 keys EN/NL), gallery/home/home-page wiring for 'activity' section; logActivity integrated across all 7 mutating route files (projects, memories, instructions, tasks, research, conversations, files); Drizzle enum typing fixed with `as const`. Build passes.
- 2026-08-12 AI Context Pipeline implemented: `lib/project-context.ts` assembles six scoped sources (identity, instructions, memory, files w/ text excerpt, history from other project chats, research runs) into the PROJECT CONTEXT block; `chat.ts` `buildProjectContext` now delegates to it; all queries strictly filtered by projectId. Build passes.
- 2026-08-12 Chat-shell hardcoded-color cleanup verified: `pnpm run typecheck` and `git diff --check` pass; user bubble, header actions (GroupSettings/ConversationActions), voice/camera back buttons, and the settings avatar badge now use theme tokens instead of hardcoded light/dark hexes.
- 2026-08-12 Jarvis composer cleanup: the input now uses a centered max-width surface with neutral theme tokens instead of competing hardcoded light/dark pill styles.
- 2026-08-12 Jarvis conversation-feed cleanup: assistant content now sits in a bounded reading column, user bubbles have a readable maximum width, and feed spacing is less cramped.
- 2026-08-12 Jarvis Projects cleanup: the Projects section starts collapsed so the conversation list remains the primary sidebar focus.
- 2026-08-12 Jarvis sidebar cleanup: navigation is grouped, the workspace header is compact, and footer actions no longer compete with the top toolbar.

## Active threads
- **Build Mode (Infinity) Phase 0: UI Unfuck** — **COMPLETE**: All mobile/desktop UI components built and integrated. Typecheck + build pass.
- **Build Mode (Infinity) Phase 1: Foundation** — **COMPLETE**: Git worktree isolation, checkpoint/resume system, atomic commits, instant rollback. Typecheck + build pass.
- **Build Mode (Infinity) Phase 2: Loop Intelligence** — **COMPLETE**: Diff preview ✓, verification loop ✓, parallel fan-out ✓, modular prompts ✓, retry loop with fixer prompt ✓, UI diff modal integration ✓, wire /build/execute-plan ✓.
- **Build Studio reliability:** visible progress transcript, plan/scaffold error handling, cancellation, bounded self-review pipeline implemented and verified; no active code changes remain.
- **Projects System** — core backend, Project Memory, Project Instructions, Projects navigation, AI Context Pipeline, and Project Activity are implemented and verified. Next work: Project Files, Project Research, Project Tasks, or UI cleanup.
- **Book Studio** — fully built + wired, server `.env` now ready for live end-to-end run.
- **Gem → Expert rename** — **COMPLETE (10/10)**: User-facing + internal backend terminology now consistent. DB `kind:"gem"`, API `gemSystemPrompt`/`gemConversationId` kept as documented legacy contract.

## Next actions
1. **Phase 3: Context & Memory** — Smart working context (fileMap, keyDecisions, errorPatterns, tokenBudget, compaction), project-scoped memory injection into build loop.
2. **Phase 4: Developer Experience** — Workspace snapshots + one-click rollback (history.ts already has snapshots, need build-specific export), browser pool (puppeteer-browser.ts exists, need pooling), resource limits + cost tracking, command palette (build-command-palette.tsx exists, need server-side actions).
3. **Phase 5: Polish** — Telemetry/debug event stream, export/share builds, edge cases (network failure retry, disk full pause, rate limit queue, git conflict merge, workspace corruption detect, concurrent build queue).

## Locked decisions
- Projects System: **plan-first** — build only after all requirements are planned (user instruction).
- Build Mode (Infinity): follow `BUILD_MODE_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` phases sequentially (Phase 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5).
- Continuity: KNOWLEDGE.md + session-brief.md replace the old logs; raw history in `archive/`.
- Memory rule: no personal trivia — only project state, changes, and how-it-works.

## Open questions
- Switch launcher to `claude --continue` for literal chat continuation? (not decided)
